We recommend to use this sample with the [Unity Measured Materials Library](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/unity-measured-materials-library-138814).

## Requirements

* PiXYZ PLUGIN for Unity 2019.1
* Unity 2018.3

## Car Configurator Sample

Since 2019.1, PiXYZ is proud to manage VRED scenes import directly in Unity (more info soon in the documentation). This comes with a set of methods and components to handle variants and animations. This demo shows you how to use this API to list all model variants automatically, display them in a menu and select them at runtime.

The menus are generated automatically and this demo will work with any VRED model imported with our 2019.1 PLUGIN for Unity.
