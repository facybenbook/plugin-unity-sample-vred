## How to use ?

A PiXYZ Plugin for Unity is required (licensed or trial) to import VRED files. We recommend to use this sample with the [Unity Measured Materials Library](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/unity-measured-materials-library-138814).

## Requirements

* PiXYZ PLUGIN for Unity 2019.1 or higher

## Car Configurator Sample

For the 2019.1, PiXYZ introduced VRED scenes import in Unity. This comes with a set of methods and components to handle switches and variant sets. This demo shows you how to use this API to list all model variants automatically, display them in a menu and select them at runtime.

The menus are generated automatically so this demo will work with any VRED model imported with our 2019.1 PLUGIN for Unity.
